The main focus to create a new database for company to  keep each records. From this database system we have keep tracks of all the humans who are connecting with us. Like  if we get employees  segment it will be devided in to many parts as a example employees can be a tour guide or a driver or a manager.so we should have to keep all the trackings of each of them. And also persons can be a consumer. Our first priority should go to keep tacking of consumers mostly. As well as we should identify the consumers  wether they are old customer or a current customer
